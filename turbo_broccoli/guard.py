class GuardedBlockHandler:
    """
    A guarded block handler allows to guard an entire block/loop of code.

    ### Guarded block

    Use it as follows:

    ```py
    h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
    for _ in h.guard():
        # This whole block will be skipped if out/foo.json exists
        # If not, don't forget to set the results:
        h.result = ...
    # In any case, the results of the block are available in h.result
    ```

    (I know the syntax isn't the prettiest. It would be more natural to use a
    `with h.guard():` syntax but python doesn't allow for context managers that
    don't yield...)

    The handler's `result` is `None` by default. If left to `None`, no output
    file is created. This allows for scenarios like

    ```py
    h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json")
    for _ in h.guard():
        ... # Guarded code
        if success:
            h.result = ...
    ```

    So if the guarded code did not succeed, then `out/foo.json` is not created,
    and so the next time, it will be run again.

    Note that the parent directory of the output file (in this case, `out/`)
    will be created if it does not exist.

    Bonus: if you don't need to use `h.result` after the block, you can be even
    more concise:

    ```py
    for h in GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo.json").guard():
        ...
    ```

    i.e. `GuardedBlockHandler.guard` yields itself.

    ### Guarded loop

    If an iterable `l` is passed to `h.guard`, then `for _ in h.guard(l):`
    iterates over `l`, and after every iteration, an artifact is created using
    the current value of `h.result` at `<output_path>/<str(element)>`. For
    example:

    ```py
    l = [1, 2, 3]  # The elements of l must be stringable
    h = GuardedBlockHandler("out/foo")
    for x in h.guard(l):
        # At the begining of every iteration, h.result is guaranteed to be a
        # dict with key str(x) being None. The result of past iterations are
        # also in h.result
        h.result[x] = {"bar": int(x) + 1}
    # now, h.result is {"1": {"bar": 2}, "2": {"bar": 3}, ...}
    ```

    creates folder `out/foo` in which there will be files `1.json`, `2.json`,
    `3.json` respectively containing `{"bar": 2}`, `{"bar": 3}`, `{"bar": 4}`.
    Of course, if any of these files existed prior to running the `for` loop
    (e.g. `out/foo/2.json`), then the corresponding iteration (in that case `x
    = 2`) is skipped.

    **Warning**: The `x` in the loop above are actually strings! More generally,
    `h.guard(l)` actually iterates over `map(str, l)`.

    Consider an expensive function `f` that returns a TurboBroccoli/JSON-izable
    `dict`. Wrapping/decorating `f` using `produces_document` essentially saves
    the result at a specified path and when possible, loads it instead of
    calling `f`. For example:

    ```py
    _f = produces_document(f, "out/result.json")
    _f(*args, **kwargs)
    ```

    will only call `f` if the `out/result.json` does not exist, and otherwise,
    loads and returns `out/result.json`. Note that the parent directory of the
    output file (in this case, `out/`) will be created if it does not
    exist.However, if `out/result.json` exists and was produced by calling
    `_f(*args, **kwargs)`, then

    ```py
    _f(*args2, **kwargs2)
    ```

    will still return the same result. If you want to keep a different file for
    each `args`/`kwargs`, set `check_args` to `True` as in

    ```py
    _f = produces_document(f, "out/result.json")
    _f(*args, **kwargs)

    In this case, the arguments must be TurboBroccoli/JSON-izable, i.e. the
    document

    ```
    {
        "args": args,
        "kwargs": kwargs,
    }
    ```

    must be TurboBroccoli/JSON-izable. The resulting file is no longer
    `out/result.json` but rather `out/result.json/<hash>.json` where `hash` is
    the MD5 hash of the serialization of the `args`/`kwargs` document above.
